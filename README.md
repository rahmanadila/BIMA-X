# BIMA-X Website

## Description
BIMA-X is a frontend web interface developed as part of a **Project-Based Learning (PBL)** course. The website is designed to display **real-time health measurement data** collected from a sensor-based system and present the information in a clear and user-friendly interface.

## System Overview
The system consists of multiple sensors connected to an **ESP32 microcontroller** to measure:
- Body weight
- Height
- Blood pressure
- Body Mass Index (BMI)

The website serves as the **client-side interface** for visualizing measurement results and interacting with users.

## Features
- Real-time display of measurement data (weight, height, blood pressure, BMI)
- User data input form
- Display of calculated BMI results
- Ability to send measurement results to the user's email
- Structured and responsive user interface

## Scope
This project focuses on **frontend development only**, including user interface design and client-side interaction. Backend services, email handling, and sensor communication are handled outside the scope of this repository.

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- ESP32 (hardware integration, system-level)

## Project Type
Academic Project – Project-Based Learning (PBL)
